# Network Security Labs

Welcome to my **Network Security Labs** repository. This collection of labs showcases the core security concepts and skills I developed during my study of network security. These labs focus on the installation, troubleshooting, and monitoring of network devices to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of enterprise data in modern network infrastructures.

## My Learning Objectives
Through these labs, I gained essential skills to:

- **Identify Modern Security Threats:** Understand the security threats facing modern network infrastructures and their implications.
- **Secure Cisco Devices:** Configure and harden Cisco devices to enhance network security.
- **Protect Network Infrastructures:** Implement techniques and best practices to secure the network infrastructure against vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Implement AAA:** Use Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) on Cisco routers with both local databases and external AAA servers.
- **Mitigate Router and Network Threats:** Configure and apply access control lists (ACLs) to protect Cisco routers and networks from threats.
- **Design Secure Networks:** Plan and implement secure network designs, effective management strategies, and reporting mechanisms.
- **Use Cisco IOS Firewall Features:** Configure and use the Cisco IOS firewall feature set to enhance network security.
- **Defend Against Layer 2 Attacks:** Recognize and mitigate common Layer 2 attacks, such as MAC spoofing and VLAN hopping.
- **Implement VPN Solutions:** Configure site-to-site and remote access VPNs to provide secure communications over untrusted networks.

## Labs Overview
This repository contains practical, hands-on labs that provided me with real-world experience with network security concepts and tools. Each lab includes:

- A **detailed description** of the learning objectives and tasks.
- Step-by-step **instructions** for implementation.
- Configuration examples for Cisco devices.
- Troubleshooting tips and verification steps.

## Tools and Requirements
To complete these labs, I used:

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** and other simulation/emulation software.
- Cisco routers and switches (both physical and virtual).
- My foundational knowledge of networking concepts and the Cisco IOS command-line interface.
